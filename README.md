## Abstract
Building AI models with trustworthiness is important especially in regulated areas such as healthcare. In tackling COVID-19, previous work uses convolutional neural networks as the backbone architecture, which has shown to be prone to over-caution and overconfidence in making decisions, rendering them less trustworthy -- a crucial flaw in the context of medical imaging. In this study, we propose a feature learning approach using Vision Transformers, which use an attention-based mechanism, and examine the representation learning capability of Transformers as a new backbone architecture for medical imaging. Through the task of classifying COVID-19 chest radiographs, we investigate into whether generalization capabilities benefit solely from Vision Transformers' architectural advances. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are conducted on the trustworthiness of the models, through the use of "trust score" computation and a visual explainability technique. We conclude that the attention-based feature learning approach is promising in building trustworthy deep learning models for healthcare.

*Swin-B and ResNet-50 Ablation-CAMs for 3 selected COVID-positive chest X-rays. ResNet-50 is chosen as a representative because it produced better results and localization maps than Densenet-121. Warm colors (red, orange) indicate high importance, cold colors (blue, green) indicate lower importance.*

# Training Instructions
- Instructions for creating the COVIDx9B dataset can be found at the [main COVID-Net repository.](https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net)
- For singular finetuning, run `finetune.py`
- For k-fold finetuning, run `finetune_kfolds.py`
- For arguments, see `training_args.py` for further clarification. Here, you can specify the model architecture (ResNet, DenseNet, Swin-B/Swin-T/Swin-S/Swin-L, ConvNeXt)
- To calculate trust scores, see `get_trust_score.py`. This script uses its own arguments rather than `training_args.py`.
